    "In this project, we will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found [here]('https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey') and the DETE survey can be found [here]('https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey').\n",
    "\n",
    "We will play the role of data analyst and attempt to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",

    "We will combine results from both surveys to answer these questions."
