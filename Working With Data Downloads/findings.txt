There appears to be a 50/50 split between male and female students at schools
which are not classified as juvenille detention centers. However, there are
5-6 times more male students than female students at those facilities which
were classified as juvenille detention facilities.

There does not appear to be a significant difference in male-to-female
enrollment at magnet schools vs. non-magnet schools.

When comparing the racial demographics of the data set when compared to the 
demographics of the United States as a whole (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Demography_of_the_United_states#Race_and_ethnicity), the percentages are
about equal. The one difference is our data set shows White students
comprising about 50% of total enrollment, whereas the Census data shows
that the United States is 73% White. However, one difference in our data
set from the Census data is that our data set classifies Hispanic as a 
separate race, while the Census does not consider Hispanic a race (any
race in the Census classification can be Hispanic or Non-Hispanic). Our
data set shows that about 25% of total enrollment is Hispanic students.
Thus, we can assume that these students, for the most part, are classified
as White in the Census data.
